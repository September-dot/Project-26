# Red-Velvet-Cake
# A light chocolate cake with lots of addictive cream cheese frosting and a crown of buttercream roses. This cake is moist but so light and fluffy, it really is the perfect match for all that delicious frosting! You can make this without any food coloring and it will be a light tan color, not quite red, but it will be eaten just as quickly!

#  I did a lot of recipe testing for this much-requested cake but in the end I lightly adapted the recipe for the batter from a New York Times recipe. Wonderful moist fluffy sponge, and I loved the typo saying it made 8 inch layers! LOL, even the best of us make mistakes…Check out my Chocolate Beet Cake to see what happens when you skip the food coloring!

# HOW DO YOU DECORATE A CAKE?
# I covered the outside in crumbs and topped it with delicate buttercream flowers for some extra visual oomph. A definite time saver would be to pipe some cream cheese  frosting dollops on top or make a rope pattern like I used in my dulce de leche cake.
